Despite his innocent appearance, Geoff is actually an illegal squatter. He just kinda showed up one day (friend gave him to me without asking), but since he seemed nice I decided to let him stay even though we were at max capacity. Since then, he has remained the smallest of the 4 fish, but still enjoys heavyweight boxing since he is able to be in a lower weight bracket than the rest.
